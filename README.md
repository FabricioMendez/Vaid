<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our platform is designed to optimize NGO management and enhance volunteer engagement. This comprehensive system is built on three fundamental pillars: human resources management, resource management, and event/activities management. 

Through an immersive online application, individuals can sign up as volunteers, providing relevant personal information and qualifications. We offer a customized dashboard for each registered organization and user, featuring advanced tools for managing volunteers and staff, as well as overseeing events and internal activities.

Additionally, our platform facilitates the identification of ideal volunteers using tags and AI filters, based on skills, availability, and location. Administrators can efficiently manage accounts, assign roles, and track participation. We also integrate e-learning resources, allowing administrators to upload training videos categorized by topics. 

Our resource management capabilities include a comprehensive system for adding and modifying inventory and a buy/sell management system for tracking purchases and sales.
